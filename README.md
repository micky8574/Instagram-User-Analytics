# Instagram User Analytics

### Project Overview
---
 Analyzing user interactions and engagement with the Instagram app to provide valuable insights that can help the business grow.  
 
User analysis involves tracking how users engage with a digital product, such as a software application or a mobile app. The insights derived from this analysis can be used by various teams within the business. For example, the marketing team might use these insights to launch a new campaign, the product team might use them to decide on new features to build, and the development team might use them to improve the overall user experience.

2.Inactive User Engagement: The team wants to encourage inactive users to start posting by sending them promotional emails.
 Task: Identify users who have never posted a single photo on Instagram.

3.Contest Winner Declaration: The team has organized a contest where the user with the most likes on a single photo wins.
 Task: Determine the winner of the contest and provide their details to the team.
 
4.Hashtag Research: A partner brand wants to know the most popular hashtags to use in their posts to reach the most people.
 Task: Identify and suggest the top five most commonly used hashtags on the platform.

 Task: Determine the day of the week when most users register on Instagram. Provide insights on when to schedule an ad campaign.



**B) Investor Metrics:**

 Task: Calculate the average number of posts per user on Instagram. Also, provide the total number of photos on Instagram divided by the total number of users.
 
2.Bots & Fake Accounts: Investors want to know if the platform is crowded with fake and dummy accounts.
 Task: Identify users (potential bots) who have liked every single photo on the site, as this is not typically possible for a normal user.
